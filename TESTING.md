### Code Validation

All the code was validated on the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 
Some small errors were found on the home and inspiration pages. After a fix and retest, no errors were returned for both. 

The HTML validator results for each page are below:

* Welome Page
* Instruction Page
* Memory Game Page


On all pages same error was found. It's not affecting the operation of the site

The CSS validator didn't detect any errors.

## Responsiveness Test

* The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

## Known Bugs

 ### Unresolved

The buttons on the website should move smoothly along with the text. 
There must be changes in CSS code in order to do this.
